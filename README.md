My protine days of suggested use in a product and pound per day cost. 

## Creating class and methods

Installed nessisary dependancies and libraries using selenium to navigate the webpages and chrome as the driver. Created scraper class and methods to collect the data. Completed the 'load_and_get_links' method to fill the class attribute with a list of product links to be used. First webpage is loaded and popups are closed. Then on loop using the elements XPATH the links of products are collected and uploaded to the class attribute and the button for next page is clicked. Once all product links have been collected loop is broken.
